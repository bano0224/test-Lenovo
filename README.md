Test HTML-CSS Lenovo

Landing page (LP) Challenge:

Using this mockup as a reference: https://rebrand.ly/lenovodevtest create a landing page with the following requirements:
1)	The LP must be fully responsive. The shared mockup has the desktop view only. For Desktop you have to replicate it as “pixel-perfect” as possible. For mobile and tablet, feel free to adapt it as you consider. Use these breakpoints as a reference:
a.	Mobile: from 320px 
b.	Tablet: from 750px
c.	Desktop: from 1024px
2)	To develop the LP, use CSS and HTML only. Don’t mount any App or something similar. There is no need to add an extra complexity layer like a component’s library. CSS and HTML will suffice. Avoid using a CSS library as well. Create your own stylesheets with your own media queries and classes.
3)	For the markup, use HTML5 semantic elements.
4)	Feel free to add any dynamism via JavaScript. It is not necessary but it’s an extra that will earn you some points. 😊

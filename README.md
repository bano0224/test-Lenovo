Test HTML-CSS Lenovo

Landing page (LP) Challenge:

Using this mockup as a reference: https://rebrand.ly/lenovodevtest create a landing page with the following requirements:
1)	The LP must be fully responsive. The shared mockup has the desktop view only. For Desktop you have to replicate it as ‚Äúpixel-perfect‚Äù as possible. For mobile and tablet, feel free to adapt it as you consider. Use these breakpoints as a reference:
a.	Mobile: from 320px 
b.	Tablet: from 750px
c.	Desktop: from 1024px
2)	To develop the LP, use CSS and HTML only. Don‚Äôt mount any App or something similar. There is no need to add an extra complexity layer like a component‚Äôs library. CSS and HTML will suffice. Avoid using a CSS library as well. Create your own stylesheets with your own media queries and classes.
3)	For the markup, use HTML5 semantic elements.
4)	Feel free to add any dynamism via JavaScript. It is not necessary but it‚Äôs an extra that will earn you some points. üòä

JavaScript Challenge:

* Note: for exercises 1 and 2, don‚Äôt use built-in Array methods. Use only loop control flow statements like while, for, and do-while.
1) Create a function that receives an array of positive integers and returns an array with only the input‚Äôs pair numbers.
For example:
[INPUT]  array = [1 2 3 4];
[OUTPUT] array = [2, 4];

2) Create a function that receives a String as parameter and returns a Boolean value indicating if the word is a palindrome* or not.
*a word or group of words that is the same when you read it forwards from the beginning or backwards from the end: "Refer" and "level" are palindromes.


3) Using any JavaScript object creation pattern, create a Car object with the following attributes and methods:
 **  Attributes
 *  String: make *  String: model *  boolean: turnedOn *  int: engineDisplacement (cylinder volume)
 *  int: year

**  Methods:
 *  boolean: isOn() *  void: turnOn() *  void: turnOff() *  String: toString() [returns year, make, model and the engine displacement (cc)] * String: getMarketingData() [returns make, model and year]
 
4) Create a Bicycle object with only the make [String] , model [String] and year [int] attributes and no methods. Instantiate it and print to the console its internal state calling the getMarketingData method from the Car object.
